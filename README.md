## Industry Analysis


<a name="ScaleofAutoMobileSupplyChain"></a>
### Scale Analysis of Teamothers supply chain      

With economic development, social progress and technological innovation, the automobile industry has gradually become a capital intensive and technology intensive modern industry. Global car sales increased year by year, and the average annual growth rate of 2012 to 2016 was 3.39%. In 2016, global car sales exceeded 90 million vehicles, and in 2017, more than 97 million cars were sold in the world.

<a name="IndustrialPainPoints"></a>
### Industrial pain point structure
As far as the whole automobile industry is concerned, information closed, information opaque and other industries are always one of the factors restricting the development of the industry.

First, the quality defects of the automobile factory are not traced to the source.In the automobile market in mainland China, whether domestic or joint-venture vehicles, there may be quality defects. For example, a major problem of a US brand is the crack of the instrument table, the leakage of the engine, the abnormal sound of the transmission, and the failure of the gasoline pump. In addition, there are engine jitter, oil spills, transmission noise, internal odour of a German car, engine jitter, malfunction lights, and abnormal door and window noise. However, a car made in mainland China has a jitter engine, high noise, and eating tire wear. Even a German brand like Volkswagen has a problem with a car with a bad smell, brakes, gear changes, transmission noise. But to the automobile recall lacks a set of complete flow system.

Second, in the aftermarket, the opaque maintenance service can not be bought by the consumers.At present, the consumer "car can not afford to afford to repair" has become a common phenomenon, the car 4S store maintenance accessories price is too expensive, often thousands of yuan. Survey China Insurance Industry Association, China in the sale of car zero integer ratio (the ratio of car parts prices and vehicle sales price) is more obvious than the international market high, including a car zero integer ratio was 1200%. That is to say, the retail price of all parts of the car can be added, and 12 new cars can be purchased. The spare parts suppliers designated by the main engine factory mostly supply three parts, one is the vehicle parts for the main engine factory, the other is to supply 4S shop repair parts, and three supply parts for the authorized dealers. That is to say, the difference of channel determines the price difference of original parts in the market, and these parts cannot be traced and managed, which is also an important reason for market confusion.

<a name="OpportunityofAutomobileSupplyChain"></a>
### The opportunity to centralization to the automobile supply chain
In recent years, the status quo of the global automotive service market has not yet formed a good unified system. The market service formats are divorced from each other, and no three-dimensional ecological chain has been formed. Therefore, the car block chain of automobile service platform into relying on block chain to the center of the technical characteristics, information integrity, a true record of the car, to resolve the issue of integrity, the traditional automobile service industry information collection is not complete and information traceability problem, the real meaning of reconstruction of the automotive service market service. The car block chain vehicle service platform regards the online service platform as the information center platform, links, supports, controls and optimizes, forms a complete new service system, and brings innovation to vehicle service.

The major breakthrough of block chain is that it can complete the mutual credit transfer behavior without any intermediary's participation, solve the credit problem between automobile enterprises, and greatly improve the transaction efficiency of the automotive industry. The process is efficient, transparent and low cost, allowing the auto finance industry to eliminate the high cost, money, and time cost of the layer of audit.

Block chain technology can be used to create a register to track ownership and related financial assets such as the automobile, but also can track in the prevention of fraudulent transactions; data security, can prevent the risk of a single point of failure and the system in the automobile industry, there will be loss of data; sharing function, can be shared between the car and leasing company, effectively avoid two charges, cheat rent, Piandai case, reduce the economic losses of the company. In short, block chain technology can effectively prevent tampering information, effectively avoid the benefit modification of vehicle conditions or credit information, so as to improve the credibility of the enterprise.

## Teamothers-Open the supply chain Trust system of Automobile Industry

<a name="TeamothersSupplyChainDefinition"></a>
### Definition of Teamothers supply chain
Automobile supply chain is committed to block chain technology into the automotive industry in the trading scene, scene, scene transfer service, using the blockchain books distributed system, trust mechanism, intelligent contract, consensus mechanism, build the automotive industry chain based on trust system block technology, became the first commercial block used in the global auto industry chain. Automotive supply chain for a complete block chain of automobile trade, car circulation, automobile transportation, car rental, car sharing, car accessories, car finance and other mainstream automotive business to provide solutions, lack of trust, the credit system is caused by the lack of vehicle information sharing, intermediary fraud, identity theft, and a cash vehicle double car loan, repeat two charges, Piandai industry ills automobile industry chain in the perfect solution.

Automobile supply chain is used to the center, to trust, collective maintenance, reliable database technology features the blockchain, in information security and confidentiality of the premise, realize the sharing of business and data, to avoid data sharing, mutual distrust and serious economic losses caused by the loss of the problem, from the fundamental solution the trust problem in automobile industry. Block chain technology is the basic technology for the construction of bitcoin block chain network and transaction information encryption transmission. It is based on the principle of cryptography, not based on credit, so that any agreement can be paid directly by both parties, so it does not require the participation of third party intermediaries. It can be said that block chain is a technical scheme that collectively maintains a reliable database with four major characteristics: non tampering, centralization, distributed account and intelligent contract.

<a name="Teamothers"></a>
### What's Teamothers?
Teamothers is a new ecological vehicle service platform based on the block chain Ethernet technology. The Teamothers bring together front line technicians in the block chain industry, as well as experts in the automotive industry, through a comprehensive, in-depth market analysis, the block chain technology into the automotive industry in the trading scene, scene, scene transfer service, using the blockchain books distributed system, trust mechanism, intelligent contract, consensus mechanism, build trust system in automobile industry block chain based on technology, became the first commercial block used in the global auto industry chain.

Block chain technology establishes a trust system based on technology rather than convention rules. The "decentralization" characteristic of intelligent contract, distributed database and so on makes the automobile service industry more transparent. Authority and fairness. On the Teamothers platform, auto mainframe factory 4S stores, secondary dealers, auto trading markets, auto finance companies, auto logistics companies, small loan companies, automotive Internet, financial leasing companies, Insurance companies and banks can be based on the platform to form a perfect automobile service system to provide customers with quality services.

The users of the platform come from all over the world and choose the corresponding services according to their own needs, including expert online consultation and reservation, online purchase of automobile products, online choice of auto trading market or auto finance company, etc.

The platform can choose the products online with the token of the platform, and accept the services from the corresponding institutions of the platform through offline channels.

The core idea of Teamothers is to edit different intelligent contracts on the basis of block chain and bottom technology, then decompose the intelligent contract module, and build different visual contract functions by constructing visual operation platform. Users can easily modularized and build their own intelligent contract system based on block chain in the Teamothers.

<a name="AutoMobileBlockChain"></a>
### Matching of Automobile and Block chain
Block chain technology and the development of the automotive industry there is a sufficient "cooperation space."

On the one hand, the business mode of the automobile industry does not share with each other to some extent. They are aggregated by centralization of resources and then allocated uniformly, which is more like a kind of aggregated economy. However, the essence of the automobile industry is not to emphasize the centralization, to distribute the social resources in a way of point to point, so that the participants can pay and benefit differently in different ways. On the other hand, the blockchain essentials is connected, the weak control center, autonomous mechanism, network architecture and coupling, through distributed nodes to support real point-to-point communication, do intermediary trust. The de centralization of block chain technology can help the car industry to share it completely. In general, the automotive industry chain to block changes are as follows:

1)	From centralization to decentralization, the construction of the auto industry ecological circle.
2)	Never trust in trust, the trust crisis in the automobile industry is the past.
3)	Never safe to security, dispel user information worries.

<a name="TeamothersCharacteristics"></a>
### Characteristics of Teamothers supply chain
1)	Decentralization structure eliminates data island and data fusion and sharing across industries. 
2)	Reduce cost, high efficiency.
3)	More secure and reliable data, privacy is entirely attributable to the user.
4)	Intelligent contracts make the credit system more robust.
5)	The unified forward motivate participants to win the ecological prosperity.

<a name="TeamothersEcosystem"></a>
### Teamothers supply chain ecosystem
1) Track vehicle information system
The automobile service platform of the auto man supply chain block chain can establish a complete notarized service integrity system of automobile service. From vehicle production to discarded information records and so on, a perfect track can be formed. All information about the vehicle can not be eliminated or modified, with integrity and authenticity, so as to achieve accurate tracing.

2) Transaction trajectory system
The automotive supply chain block chain automobile service platform adopts the decentralized block chain second-hand car certification mode. This means implementing a regulatory system that is not centered on either side. The whole platform uses block chain technology to build a complete rating system for second-hand evaluation agencies, which contains complete information about used car certification agencies. Institutions and appraisers in the organization take over the evaluation of cases, including the number of cases, the process, the results, etc., can even increase customer evaluation and so on.

3) Notarized reward system (pending mining system)
The so-called mining system, refers to the chain block, each block including some or all of the recent transactions, before a block of references, and other data. It also includes a difficulty answer, and the answer is unique to each block. A new block if there is no correct answer, cannot be sent to the network in the process of mining, the essence is to solve the current block in the competition. The mathematical problems in each block are difficult to solve, but once an effective solution is found, other network nodes can easily verify the correctness of the solution. For a given block, there may be multiple effective solutions, butonly one solution to the block is needed. In the automotive supply chain block chain of automobile service platform, relying on the system of notarization reward system of mining, verify each correct answer between each node, ensure the information authority.

4) Teamothers payment application

<a name="ServiceSystem"></a>
### Service system

1) Decentralized service certification system

The block chain is a distributed account, a technical solution that collectively maintains a reliable database through centralization and trust - removal. Due to the fact that block chains can not be tampered with, under the joint efforts of many block chain organizations and companies, the centralization of trust has evolved from centralization of trust to centralization of trust based on Algorithm and data. In the automotive vehicle supply chain chain block vehicle service platform, with the centralization of trust intermediary being gradually weakened and replaced, a decentralized service authentication system was established.

P2P network platform with the underlying encryption and Hash technology to solve the data can't be falsified and delete data and other problems -- vehicle information if present in the blockchain, curing will achieve the evidence, this is not the blockchain tampering.
3.2.2 User assured service flow
Automobile supply chain chain block to the center of the automobile service platform with global trend, through all the chips, can be fully utilized in the global precipitation of small amounts of money, but also the effect of the formation of a, the formation of a new way to autonomous center, effectively enhance the quality of service platform. All vehicle information on the platform is faithfully recorded and categorized on the platform, so that it can be used by the users of the platform to get a more realistic and comprehensive information and experience of the car.

Meanwhile, the technology team of the auto supplier chain is jointly developed by the domestic block chain industry elites, the automobile association and the Silicon Valley block chain technology team, and has strong technical team and strong support.
3.2.3 Digital token trading mode
Digital tokens do not exist in the form of strings. In concept, they are the right to account on the block chain. Having these tokens is like having a key, creating a new account on the ledger, redistributing ownership to others, or allowing you to redistribute the number. In other words, digital tokens are the specific amounts of the digital resources that are controlled.

The application of bitcoin to electronic transactions on the car chain of auto supplier chain block has the characteristics of online trading of e-money. In the case of anonymity, it is necessary to find his true identity when he wants to trace and trace some information. At this point, the traceability mechanism of the block chain can be used to turn his anonymous identity into a real identity.

2) Transparent public credit system
In contrast, the current automotive investment market is chaotic, with some automotive projects being more front-oriented. But the Teamothers supply chain is guided by the application to the ground. It is a real block chain application to solve the pain point of the industry. In the traditional process, the business parties are independent and do not trust each other, lack of data security, reliable and real-time sharing, and form an isolated island of information. In the service platform of block chain of Teamothers supply chain, the business participants directly read the data, reduce the coupling degree of multi-party system, and solve the information asymmetry in the traditional process. The problem of low transfer efficiency can be applied to supply Should chain finance, cross-border remittance, inter-agency settlement and so on.

<a name="CreditSystem"></a>
### Automobile credit system
The Teamothers supply chain team builds a credit information system based on the Internet of things system to evaluate the credit data of the auto industry. Its node members include credit information agencies, users, other institutions (finance leasing companies, auto parts companies, etc.). Automotive production departments, government departments, etc., the evaluation contents mainly include the capacity of the enterprise, the flow of people, the technical ability, the management data, the circulation of goods and the sales response of the products. Through the Internet of things, these modular data access to the data model to form a car credit model. In the future, we will connect with the central banks of various countries to grant credit, access more corporate credit data. In order to shape the Teamothers supply chain credit system authority.

At the same time, in order to solve the problem of credit information abuse, the Teamothers supply chain team uses the intelligent contract of the block chain to establish the credit inquiry authorization mechanism, and records the authorization and query by using the traceability of the block chain, and the block chain is irreversible. In addition, sensitive information recorded in the block chain has been encrypted and can be checked only after authorization.

<a name="FinanceModel"></a>
### Ecological finance model
The Teamothers supply chain has extended its reach to finance after creating a credible ecosystem, including links and credit data. Using block chain technology to build an ecological financial model for the financial industry. The model will focus on the Teamothers supply chain settlement platform, radiation all financial fields, open the platform for all legitimate financial institutions, and exchange data. Interoperable credit information. Covers areas such as global settlement, insurance claims processing, syndicated loans, trade finance, capital raising, automation compliance, proxy voting, asset remortgage, and so on.The block chain technology will make the financial services trade faster, the cost will be lower, and the information island will disappear. As the history of credit and the source of the assets become an immutable part of the record, the risk is correspondingly reduced. The horizon will be widened: for example, it is easier to confirm whether the trading partners are committed to the current negotiations. As the audit track records are available at any time, the process of dispute handling will be simpler. Intelligent contracts can perform binding agreements in real time.

## Application and Value of Teamothers

<a name="UseCase"></a>
### Teamothers application scene
After creating a decentralized and credible automobile service platform, Teamothers will expand the industry in the future, provide solid technical infrastructure for more application scenarios, enhance industry efficiency, and reduce business operating costs. The platform in car rental, auto trading, automotive Internet, auto maintenance, automotive supply chain finance and other businesses will have a lot of success.

The main application scenarios of Teamothers include:
        
1) Lease information sharing
To solve the serious financial loss caused by two custody, the vehicle caused by the information is not shared by the financing leasing company is continuously swindled.

2) Set up a perfect car file
Establish a perfect record for the global automobile, easy to trace and view the complete file, eliminate the phenomenon of the universal modification of the odometer in the global automobile market to cheat the consumer at the high price.

3) Evaluation of vehicle value
Solution because of the dangerous condition of the vehicle insurance company data is not open, second-hand car dealers vehicle transaction price can only rely on the appraiser to estimate the price, value and price of man-made vehicles seriously inconsistent problem;

4) Record vehicle maintenance information
The maintenance records that solve the global maintenance plant will not be recorded in the case, resulting in the serious lack of maintenance records of many cars and the distortion of vehicle conditions;

5) Avoid the scrap car to go on the road
To solve the problem of scrapping, passing away and abandonment of discarded vehicles, the currently scrapped vehicles flow into the second-hand car market, leaving the scrapped cars on the road, causing great social problems for safety and management.

<a name="FutureValue"></a>
### Application value analysis in the future
Teamothers supply chain can provide a decentralized, authoritative automobile information sharing and management platform, which makes the whole auto supply chain service industry more standardized.

Because the block chain has outstanding performance, the application of block chain technology to the Teamothers supply chain platform will serve the development of the automobile industry better. On the one hand, the  Teamothers supply chain can not only record all relevant information of the vehicle, but also form a complete flow path by using the non tampering nature of the block chain, so as to eliminate the fake and shoddy products and protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers. At the same time, the automobile supply chain helps to strengthen the industry supervision and promote the healthy development of the automobile industry through the construction of the trust system based on technology.

On the other hand, the auto supplier supply chain builds the business ecosystem of automobile production and sales, creates high-quality vehicle sales platform, realizes online and offline interoperability, and promotes the development of the automotive industry.

<a name="TechnicalCharacters"></a>
## Technical characteristics of Teamothers platform

<a name="ConsensusMechanism"></a>
### Teamothers consensus mechanism
The value anchors of the block chain lie in the consumption and output of the chain itself. When block chain selection PoW (Power-of-Work) is used as a consensus mechanism, the computation power of each block generation will become the cornerstone of its value. In addition, in the car supplier supply chain, each node has the ability to solve the real environmental problems, and can provide products and services for all kinds of shared industries. If each node in the automotive supply chain can participate in the settlement of the shared work, the whole block chain has a realistic output value. Therefore, in order to maximize the self value of the block chain, the auto man supply chain will choose the PoW based consensus mechanism by default. The key point of POW is that the greater the calculation force, the greater the probability of digging into the block, and the greater the weight of the maintenance block chain security.

However, because PoW has a dominant disadvantage such as slow transaction speed, the consensus mechanism of subsequent data link in the platform will be designed to modularized. It can be configured by controlling chain parameters, and it can be applied to different application scenarios of public chain and private chain dynamically. The sharing and collaboration big data platform of the automotive supplier chain will choose the appropriate consensus mechanism for the application scenarios and transaction situations of the data chain itself, so as to ensure that all the distributed nodes achieve data consistency through algorithm.

<a name="CryptographyPrinciple"></a>
### Autobot Cryptography principle
The cryptographic principle of the Teamothers supply chain is an improvement of the traditional etheric workshop.

1) Symmetric encryption：Symmetric encryption is the fastest and simplest way to encrypt. Encryption and decryption  use the same secret key. Symmetric encryption usually uses a relatively small key, usually less than 256 bit. The size of the key has to take care of both security and efficiency, and it is a trade-off.

2) Asymmetric encryption：Asymmetric encryption provides a very secure way for data encryption and decryption. It uses a pair of keys, public key (public key) and private key (private key). The private key can only be safekept by one party and can not be released, and the public key can be sent to anyone who requests it. Asymmetric encryption uses this to encrypt one of the keys, while decryption requires another key.

3) Private key：Non - public, is a 256 - bit random number that is kept by the user and is not open to the outside world. The private key is usually generated by the system randomly. It is the sole proof of user account usage and ownership of assets in the account. Its effective bit length is large enough, so it is impossible to break through, and there is no hidden danger.

4) Public key：Publicly, each private key has a public key that matches it. The ECC public key can be generated by the private key through unidirectional and deterministic algorithm. Currently, the commonly used schemes include secp256r1 (International Standard), secp256k1 (bitcoin standard) and SM2 (China National Standard). The Teamothers supply chain control chain and the initial data chain selection secp256r1 are used as key schemes.

5) Hash algorithm：Hash algorithm is usually referred to as the secure hashing algorithm SHA, which is a series of cryptographic hash functions issued by the National Security Council of the United States, issued by the national standard and Technology Research Institute of the United States (NIST), including variants such as SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. At present, the bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm. In addition to the PoW, the other hash algorithms refer to the SHA-256.

<a name="DistributedControl"></a>
### The distributed control structure of Teamothers
The block chain of Teamothers constructs a distributed structure system based on the open source, decentralized protocol determined by the system. The information of value exchange is distributed and sent to the whole network, and the information content is determined by distributed bookkeeping. After timestamp, block data is generated and sent to each node by distributed propagation, which realizes distributed storage. Specifically, the distributed structure is embodied in three aspects:

1) Distributed accounts.The Teamothers supply chain establishes a distributed accounting system in which everyone can participate in the recording of information by voluntary principle, so that the accounting responsibility is decentralized and recorded by all the participants in the whole network.

2) Distributed communication.Every new transaction in block chain is distributed by distributed structure. According to P2P network layer protocol, messages are sent directly to all other nodes in the whole network by a single node.

3) Distributed storage.Let all the data in the database be stored in all the computer nodes of the system and update in real time. Completely de centralized structure settings enable data to be recorded in real time and updated in every network node that participates in data storage, which greatly improves the security of database.

Through distributed, accounting, distributed communication and distributed storage, the three distribution systems are centralization of data storage, transaction verification and information transmission. The use of distributed way to exchange brokered settlement, the seller and the seller Guadan Guadan buffer block chain. When consensus node keeping books, triggering automatic trading pending, the bill will spread to the distributed network, the node verifies above 51% after the completion of the transaction. The advantage of distributed matching transaction settlement is that every transaction is well documented. Every transaction has been confirmed by the most extensive nodes. It improves the security of transaction records and increases the difficulty of hackers to manipulate the trading disk. 
Please refer to White Paper for a figure with the parameter and model of the distributed control chain of the auto man supply chain.

<a name="InternalStructure"></a>
### Internal structure of distributed Control chain Block for Teamothers
The structure of a single block chain of Teamothers data blocks consists of three parts:
(1) Data area block;
(2) List of transactions;
(3) Uncle block header list.

Among which:
The list of transactions includes as many transactions as possible, similar to: 
'''
transaction_list = [
transaction 1,
transaction 2,
...
]
uncle list = [ uncle_block_header_1, uncle_block_header_2,...]
'''    

<a name="AutobotCurrencySystem"></a>
## Autobot currency system

<a name="SettlementCurrency"></a>
### Teamothers settlement currency
1) Application mode
Teamothers settlement currency is issued by block chain management agencies, users can be used to participate in the Teamothers contract third-party settlement platform presale.

Users can use Teamothers platform for multi-currency settlement, online settlement, offline consumption.Can be used for small loans, large-value trade, overseas remittances and so on.

Teamothers settlement currency, as an asset, can be used for investment platform, can also be used for other digital currency exchange and exchange between the platform, can also be used to exchange currency between.

2) Central governance
In a decentralization system, any decision has to be completed in a fixed period of time, which changes depending on the content of the proposal. The proposal will be implemented if and only if a vote of enough high rights is collected, otherwise the proposal will be closed. In the decentralized autonomous system, and not the interests of high low interest can What I say goes., together with higher balance of rights.

The content of centralization autonomy includes, but is not limited to, registration, currency registration, statistical function, mortgage token area and so on. These escalation can be decided by the participation of autonomous system participants.

3) Original ecological mobility
The agreement token itself follows the ERC20 standard and has a native liquidity on the basis of an intelligent contract. This means that users do not have to buy and sell auto settlement currency on the traditional exchanges, but by using this way of discussion, we can achieve the centralization and coordination of the Autobot agreement itself. This is due to the flexible fee model of the agreement.

4) Central governance
Support currency registration：The Teamothers platform Agreement will periodically adjust the currencies supported, some digital currencies will exit the platform because trading volumes are too low, and some new digital currencies will join the platform. These currencies will need to be recorded in smart contracts. Including currency name, code name and corresponding intelligent contract address and other information.

Exchange registration：The exchange needs to be registered to complete the transaction through the agreement. When the exchange reaches a certain quantity, the new registered exchange must be voted through the autonomous system to pass.

Statistical function：With the longer running time of the exchange, the amount of data is accumulated, and the indexes and functions used for statistics will gradually mature. The participants in the autonomous system can decide to add or eliminate statistical functions.

The scope of the mortgage：The number of tokens that can be mortgaged by an exchange needs to be limited to a certain extent. If the number of mortgages is too large, it will lead to the difference in the liquidity of the token; if the mortgage is too small, it can not reflect the difference between the exchanges.

<a name="RiskWarning"></a>
## Risk Warning

<a name="Risk1"></a>
### The risk of losing the token caused by the loss of certificate
The buyer's token is likely to be associated with a Autobot account before being allocated to the purchaser. The only way to enter the Autobot account is the relevant login certificate selected by the purchaser, which will lead to the loss of the token. The best way to store logon credentials safely is to separate documents into one or more places and store them safely.

<a name="Risk2"></a>
### The risk related to the core agreement of the Tai Fang
The Autobot token and application based on Ethernet Fang technology development, so any fault happened Fang core protocol of Ethernet, the function problem can not be expected or attacks are likely to lead to a Autobot or tokens used in strange ways to stop working or loss of function.

<a name="Risk3"></a>
### Risk associated with the purchaser's credentials
Any third party obtains the login credential or private key of the buyer, that is, it is possible to directly control the buyer's token. In order to minimize the risk, buyers must protect their electronic devices in order to prevent unauthorized access requests from passing and accessing device contents.

<a name="Risk4"></a>
### Risks related to judicial supervision
Block chain technology has become the main object of supervision in all major countries in the world, if the regulatory body to intervene or influence Autobot application or tokens may be affected, such as the statute of limitations, sales, electronic tokens such as tokens may be restricted, even hinder the development of direct termination Autobot application.

<a name="Risk5"></a>
### Risk of lack of attention in Teamothers applications
The possibility that Teamothers applications are not used by a large number of individuals or organizations means that there is not enough public interest in developing and developing these related distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could have a negative impact on tokens and Teamothers applications.

<a name="Risk6"></a>
### Risk of Autobot related applications or products falling short of standards
The expected risks for Teamothers themselves or purchasers are currently in the development stage and may be subject to major changes prior to the release of the official version. Any Teamothers themselves or buyers' expectations or imagination of the function or form of Teamothers applications or tokens (including the behavior of the participants) may fall short of expectations, and any erroneous analysis, A design change, etc., can cause this to happen.

<a name="Risk7"></a>
### Risk of vulnerability or the risk of rapid development of cryptography
The rapid development of cryptography or the development of science and technology, such as the development of quantum computers, or the risk of cracking will bring to the encrypted tokens and the Teamothers platform, which may lead to the loss of tokens.

<a name="Risk8"></a>
### Risk of mining attack on behalf of coins
Likeing other decentralized cryptographic and encrypted tokens, block chains used in Teamothers applications are vulnerable to mining attacks, such as twin-flop attacks, high-power proportional attacks, self-interest mining attacks, and over-competitive attacks. Any successful attack is a risk for Teamothers applications, and while Teamothers are working very hard to improve the security of the system, the mining attack risks described above are real.

<a name="Risk9"></a>
### Risk of lack of maintenance or use
First of all, tokens should not be regarded as an investment, although token may have some value after a certain time, but if the Teamothers lack of maintenance or use, this value may be very small. If this happens, there may be no follow-up followers or fewer followers without this platform. Obviously, it is very bad for the tokens.

<a name="Risk10"></a>
### Risk of uninsured losses
Unlike bank accounts or the accounts of other financial institutions, stored in "Teamothers" accounts or on the Ethernet network, there is usually no insurance coverage for losses in any case, and no public individual organization will insure against your losses. But such as FDIC or private insurance companies will provide insurance for buyers.

<a name="Risk11"></a>
### Risk of dissolution
There is a possibility that for a variety of reasons, including ETH's own price fluctuations, Teamothers application development encountered problems, For possible reasons such as broken business relationships or intellectual property claims, Teamothers could be hit hard or disbanded at any time.

<a name="Risk12"></a>
### Risk of failure in applications
The Teamothers platform may not be able to provide services properly due to various reasons, which may lead to the loss of users' tokens.

<a name="Risk13"></a>
### Unforeseen other risks
Cryptography token is a new and untested technology, in addition to the risks mentioned in this paper, there are also some Teamothers team have not yet mentioned or not expected to risk, in addition, other risks may also appear suddenly, appeared in a variety of combinations or already mentioned risk way.

<a name="Others"></a>
