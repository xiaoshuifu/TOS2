[![Build Status](https://jenkins/tbc)](https://jenkins/tbc)

Welcome to Teamothers platform!
Teamothers is a new ecological vehicle service platform based on the block chain Ethernet technology. The Teamothers bring together front line technicians in the block chain industry, as well as experts in the automotive industry, through a comprehensive, in-depth market analysis, the block chain technology into the automotive industry in the trading scene, scene, scene transfer service, using the blockchain books distributed system, trust mechanism, intelligent contract, consensus mechanism, build trust system in automobile industry block chain based on technology, became the first commercial block used in the global automobile industry chain.

Now follow me onto the exploration of Teamothers platform!

## Industry Analysis

### Scale Analysis of Teamothers supply chain      

With economic development, social progress and technological innovation, the automobile industry has gradually become a capital intensive and technology intensive modern industry. Global car sales increased year by year, and the average annual growth rate of 2012 to 2016 was 3.39%. In 2016, global car sales exceeded 90 million vehicles, and in 2017, more than 97 million cars were sold in the world.

<a name="IndustrialPainPoints"></a>
### Industrial pain point structure
As far as the whole automobile industry is concerned, information closed, information opaque and other industries are always one of the factors restricting the development of the industry.

First, the quality defects of the automobile factory are not traced to the source.In the automobile market in mainland China, whether domestic or joint-venture vehicles, there may be quality defects. For example, a major problem of a US brand is the crack of the instrument table, the leakage of the engine, the abnormal sound of the transmission, and the failure of the gasoline pump. In addition, there are engine jitter, oil spills, transmission noise, internal odour of a German car, engine jitter, malfunction lights, and abnormal door and window noise. However, a car made in mainland China has a jitter engine, high noise, and eating tire wear. Even a German brand like Volkswagen has a problem with a car with a bad smell, brakes, gear changes, transmission noise. But to the automobile recall lacks a set of complete flow system.

Second, in the aftermarket, the opaque maintenance service can not be bought by the consumers.At present, the consumer "car can not afford to afford to repair" has become a common phenomenon, the car 4S store maintenance accessories price is too expensive, often thousands of yuan. Survey China Insurance Industry Association, China in the sale of car zero integer ratio (the ratio of car parts prices and vehicle sales price) is more obvious than the international market high, including a car zero integer ratio was 1200%. That is to say, the retail price of all parts of the car can be added, and 12 new cars can be purchased. The spare parts suppliers designated by the main engine factory mostly supply three parts, one is the vehicle parts for the main engine factory, the other is to supply 4S shop repair parts, and three supply parts for the authorized dealers. That is to say, the difference of channel determines the price difference of original parts in the market, and these parts cannot be traced and managed, which is also an important reason for market confusion.

### The opportunity to centralization to the automobile supply chain
In recent years, the status quo of the global automotive service market has not yet formed a good unified system. The market service formats are divorced from each other, and no three-dimensional ecological chain has been formed. Therefore, the car block chain of automobile service platform into relying on block chain to the center of the technical characteristics, information integrity, a true record of the car, to resolve the issue of integrity, the traditional automobile service industry information collection is not complete and information traceability problem, the real meaning of reconstruction of the automotive service market service. The car block chain vehicle service platform regards the online service platform as the information center platform, links, supports, controls and optimizes, forms a complete new service system, and brings innovation to vehicle service.

The major breakthrough of block chain is that it can complete the mutual credit transfer behavior without any intermediary's participation, solve the credit problem between automobile enterprises, and greatly improve the transaction efficiency of the automotive industry. The process is efficient, transparent and low cost, allowing the auto finance industry to eliminate the high cost, money, and time cost of the layer of audit.

Block chain technology can be used to create a register to track ownership and related financial assets such as the automobile, but also can track in the prevention of fraudulent transactions; data security, can prevent the risk of a single point of failure and the system in the automobile industry, there will be loss of data; sharing function, can be shared between the car and leasing company, effectively avoid two charges, cheat rent, Piandai case, reduce the economic losses of the company. In short, block chain technology can effectively prevent tampering information, effectively avoid the benefit modification of vehicle conditions or credit information, so as to improve the credibility of the enterprise.
